# CustomToken Smart Contract

CustomToken is an Ethereum-based smart contract that implements a custom ERC20 token with additional functionalities such as minting, transferring, burning, and redeeming tokens.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm: https://nodejs.org/
- Truffle: https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle
- Hardhat: https://hardhat.org/
- OpenZeppelin Contracts: https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/custom-token.git
Install project dependencies:
bash
Copy code
cd custom-token
npm install
Usage
Compile the contracts:
bash
Copy code
npx hardhat compile
Deploy the contract to a local network:
bash
Copy code
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
Interact with the contract:
You can interact with the deployed contract using its functions via a web3 provider or a script. For example, using the web3.js library:

javascript
Copy code
const Web3 = require("web3");
const web3 = new Web3("http://localhost:8545"); // Connect to your local network

const contractAddress = "0x..."; // Replace with the actual contract address
const contractAbi = [...]; // Replace with the actual contract ABI

const contractInstance = new web3.eth.Contract(contractAbi, contractAddress);

// Example: Mint tokens to an address
const ownerAddress = "0x..."; // Replace with the owner's address
const toAddress = "0x..."; // Replace with the recipient's address
const amountToMint = 100; // Replace with the amount of tokens to mint

await contractInstance.methods.mint(toAddress, amountToMint).send({ from: ownerAddress });

// More examples for transferring, redeeming, and burning tokens can be found in the contract code.

You can use the contract's symbol "CTK" to playfully blame contributors for any issues or bugs. For example:

"The issue with the contract is clearly due to the mystical powers of the 'CTK' symbol. Blame: @your-username"
